Extraction of Region of Interest from fingerprint images using Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning techniques

## Abstract
Extracting a consistent and accurate Region of Interest (ROI) from fingerprint images is crucial for reliable and effective fingerprint recognition systems. In recent
years, deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning (RL) methodologies have been
employed to extract ROIs from fingerprint images. The combination of these two
techniques has shown promising results in improving the accuracy and consistency
of ROI extraction. In this study, we aim to develop a DL-RL-based approach for
ROI extraction from fingerprint images, with a specific focus on the core point of
the fingerprint. The DL model, You Only Look Once (YOLO), is used to extract
a bounding box around the core point of the fingerprint image. The RL method,
Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN), is then employed to modify the ROI for better
recognition accuracy. The extracted ROI is evaluated for its FRR, FAR, and Accuracy across multiple datasets, highlighting the importance of ROI in fingerprint
recognition systems.
